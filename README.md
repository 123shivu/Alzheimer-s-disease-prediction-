# Alzheimer-s-disease-prediction-
This project aims to predict Alzheimer's disease using machine learning techniques on medical and cognitive data. It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and training models like SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. The goal is to detect early signs of Alzheimer's for timely intervention and improved patient care.
